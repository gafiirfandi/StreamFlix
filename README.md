<b>StreamFlix Flitts Intern Assessment Project</b>

Hi, My name is Gafirazi Irfandi. This is the source code of the project.
I use ReactJS for the frontend. I use modules like redux, redux-persist to keep the state alive in the local storage.
So when you try to refresh the page, the amount of money and the list that consists of owned movies will be persistent until you clear the local storage.

I made 2 pages for the website they are:

- Homepage: display list of now playing movies in US region
- Detail page: display details of a certain movie

There is a purchase feature that you can try, by clicking on a certain detail page of a movie. Then, you click the buy button, after that the system will notify you that you have successfully purchased a movie. Then the movie will have a tag called "owned" and cannot be bought anymore. So, automatically your money will decrease as much as the price of the movie that you bought.

How to use:

- Just click the link below
